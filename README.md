# LLM-Cookbook
Data: I took car manuals (Subaru Impreza, Toyota Camry, Hyundai i20 etc). 
Method: Stage 1: Vanilla RAG model using embedding (hkunlp/instructor-large) and Mistral 7B model for LLM. Used standard chunking and storing in Chromadb. 

We start with a normal QARetriever. 
We then evaluate with a hybrid search
